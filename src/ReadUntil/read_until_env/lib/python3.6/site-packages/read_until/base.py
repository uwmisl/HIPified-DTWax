        To set up and use a client:

        >>> read_until_client = ReadUntilClient()

        This creates an initial connection to a MinKNOW instance in

        >>> with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        ...     executor.submit(analysis_function, read_until_client)

        To stop processing the gRPC read stream:

        >>> read_until_client.reset()

        If an analysis function is set up as above in response to
        `client.is_running`, calling the above call will cause the
